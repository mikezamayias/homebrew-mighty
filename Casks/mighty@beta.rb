  caveats <<~EOS
    This is the Mighty beta channel. It installs the same Mighty.app bundle as
    stable, but the DMG comes from /downloads/candidates/ and may be less
    polished than the latest stable cask (`mighty`).

    Do not install both `mighty` and `mighty@beta` at the same time — they
    share the Mighty.app install path.
